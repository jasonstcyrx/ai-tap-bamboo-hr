When you use this API you will provide a timestamp and the results will be limited to just the employees that have changed since the time you provided. This API operates on an employee-last-changed-timestamp, which means that a change in ANY individual field in the employee record, as well as any change to the employment status, job info, or compensation tables, will cause that employee to be returned via this API.Sample Response

Date Format
The "since" parameter is an ISO 8601 date in one of the following formats:
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+hh:mm
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss-hh:mm
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+hhmm
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss-hhmm
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ
where:
yyyy=four digit year
mm=month 01-12
dd=day of month 01-31
hh=hour 00-23
mm=minute 00-59
ss=second 00-59
T=literally the letter "T"
Z=literally the letter "Z"
NOTE: Documentation will reference positive offsets (+hh:mm, +hhmm) with the '+' symbol for correctness, but because the symbol has meaning within a url, an alternate character set for that symbol will have to be used in actual requests: %2B. So the result would be: %2Bhh:mm, %2Bhhmm. %2B will be converted to + by the time we receive the request.
The final format is for expressing a time in UTC. The other four formats are for expressing the time as an offset from UTC. In these formats the first two digits are the hours to offset and the last two digits are the minutes. So +02:00 means two hours after UTC.
Example: July 4th, 2011 at 1:05pm Mountain Standard Time would be expressed as: 2011-07-04T13:05:00-07:00
Possible Types (optional)
Use one of these in the {type} variable in the URL: "inserted", "updated", "deleted"
Response
The response will contain a series of "employee" tags. Each tag represents a single employee that was changed. The "id" attribute is the employee ID that can be used to make additional API calls. There is an "action" attribute that will say whether the employee was "inserted", "updated", or "deleted". There will also be a "lastChanged" attribute that specifies what time the most recent change was to the record. If an employee was updated multiple times, only the time of the most recent change will be reflected in the timestamp. In the scenario where the "since" date parameter is BEFORE the date that the user was created, the API will return the date that the user was "inserted".  If the "since" date is AFTER the date the user was created, the API will return the date that the user was last "updated".
As a convenience, the outermost "changeList" tag will have a "latest" attribute that identifies the most recent change of all changes returned by the API call. You can use this timestamp as the "since" parameter in a subsequent call to get changes since that the previous call to this API method.
