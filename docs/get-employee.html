This is suitable for getting basic employee information, including current values for fields that are part of a historical table, like job title, or compensation information.

Sample Response
JSONXML{
    "id":123,
    "firstName":"John",
    "lastName":"Doe"
}
<employee id="123">
    <field id="firstName">John</field>
    <field id="lastName">Doe</field>
</employee>

Parameters
The {fieldList} is a comma separated list of values taken from the official list of field names. {number} is an employee ID. The special employee ID of zero (0) means to use the employee ID associated with the API key (if any).
Compatibility Note
For backwards compatibility reasons the state field has an inconsistent behavior for just this API call. It will not return the full name of a state. Rather, it returns the two character US state abbreviation. For international addresses, the state will either be the plain text name if the user hand entered it, or the 2-3 character state/province abbreviation if they selected it from a drop down.
