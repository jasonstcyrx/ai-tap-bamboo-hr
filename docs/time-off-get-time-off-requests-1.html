Notes
The response will be limited to those employees and time off types that the owner of the API key used to make the request has view access to.
The start and end date parameters will show time off if any day in the time off request falls within the dates specified, even if part of the time off falls outside of the time specified.
Clients should be ready for any number of "note" elements.
If there are zero notes for a request then the "notes" tag will be still included as an empty array.
Newer time off requests may also include details for each day of the request in a  element.
